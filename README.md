# Java Test
In order to perform this test, clone the repo, perform the activities required, then create a pull request with your code. Provide any and all comments in the pull request rather than in the code itself.

### The coding exercise consists of the following four tasks:
1. Merge the lists together, summing up the amounts for departments with the same name.
1. Sort the result list by Department.name in _DESCENDING_ order.
1. Output the results into a text file in CSV, comma delimitted format.
1. Read in the text file from #3 and output the results to console in _ASCENDING_ order by amount.

While performing this exercise you're not limited to using only core Java, you can use any external library, but make sure I can resolve the dependency on my side and build the project. _Hint:_ I will not hunt for dependencies or match versions.

**Good luck!**
